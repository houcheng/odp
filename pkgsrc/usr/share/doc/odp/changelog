1.4.x
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2002-03-19  Richard Hirst  <rhirst@linxucare.com>
* treat GPT structs as little-endian always, regardless of cpu byte order,
  now gets unique GUID byte order correct, and works on big-endian
* treat GUIDs as little-endian blobs except when calling libuuid functions,
  avoid triggering gcc ((packed)) bug
* add hp-service partition type support

2002-01-26  Andrew Cluasen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* added new/updated translations: ca, fr, da
* backported fixes from 1.6.x:
* libparted/fs_fat/resize.c (create_resize_context): copy old serial number
  on resizing (fs_info->serial_number)  (reported by Andreas Dilger)
* libparted/device.c (probe_proc_partitions): use fgets(), so we don't barf
  on junk at end-of-line  (patch by Andreas Dilger)
* released 1.4.24

2002-01-13  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* updated gl.po
* released 1.4.23

2002-01-11  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/disk_dos.c (read_table): nested calls to read_tables()
  (on nested extended partitions) are moved out into a separate loop,
  to make sure they are called after logical partitions are added.
  This makes the numbering consistent with Linux and fdisk.  Some versions
  of Disk Druid appear to make such partition tables.

2001-12-28  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* updated ja.po and gl.po
* released 1.4.22

2001-12-27  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* OUCH!  some minor ext2_mkfs fixes didn't get merged into the stable branch.
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (ext2_write_main): now writes the
group number in each superblock backup properly.

2001-12-01  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* updated fr.po

2001-11-24  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>

* released 1.4.21

2001-11-14  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/device.c (canonicalize_file_name): backported, and used
to replace (_normalize_path)

2001-11-13  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* released 1.4.21-pre1

2001-11-10  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* added pt.po (not to be confused with pt_BR.po).  Thanks Gonçalo!
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (ext2_mkfs): for FS's < 512Mb, use 1k
blocks (not 4k)

2001-11-05  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* updated de.po and da.po

2001-10-20  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/disk_gpt.c (gpt_write_pmbr): the protective MBR should contain
a partition covering the entire disk, starting from sector 1, not sector 0.

2001-10-14  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/disk_gpt.c: did %s/\%llx/" PRIx64 "/g
* configure.in: added "-Wno-format" to CFLAGS, because the PRIx64 macros
seem to confuse gcc.
* released 1.4.20

2001-10-07  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* new po/da.po (thanks Keld!)

2001-10-06  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (ext2_mkfs_init_sb): s_rev_level:
changed from PED_CPU_TO_LE16 from PED_CPU_TO_LE32 (this broke all big
endian ext2 mkfs's :( ).
* released 1.4.20-pre3

2001-10-02  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* applied gpt patch from Matt Domsch (sorry I took so long!).  If a GPT
disk doesn't have a valid protective MBR, then it gives the option of either
removing the GPT stuff or creating a valid protective MBR.
* misc cleanups in gpt (libparted/disk_gpt.c)
* libparted/disk.c (ped_partition_new): the check for attempts to create
extended partitions on non-extended partition tables was extended to logical
partitions as well
* released 1.4.20-pre2

2001-09-30  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* new po/de.po
* parted/ui.h (interactive_mode, non_interactive_mode): now accept a
PedDevice** rather than a PedDevice*: motivation: the caller (main) needs
to know what the current open device is (to close it, or whatever).
(This is a bit yucky... perhaps [non_]interactive_mode should be responsible
for opening/closing?)
* parted/parted.c (main): pass pointers to dev to (interactive_mode,
non_interactive_mode)
* parted/ui.c (interactive_mode, non_interactive_mode): dev is now a
PedDevice**
* released 1.4.20-pre1

2001-09-29  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* new po/gl.po

2001-09-28  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>

s/s_uuid/s_journal_uuid/
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2.c (ext2_open): if the ext3 recover flag is set, tell
the user to run e2fsck (to replay the journal)

2001-09-23  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_fs.h: added journaling entries to the super block,
and access macros

from the superblock to the journal inode (if there is one)
* released 1.4.19-pre4
* added po/da.po (thanks Keld!)

2001-09-19  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>

partition tables with non-lba fat partitions.
* doc/USER: minor changes wrt chs/lilo

2001-09-16  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* libparted/fs_ntfs/ntfs.c (ntfs_set_system): added hidden flag

added EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE
* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_fs.c (_inode_update_size): large file support: writes
to i_size_high
* released 1.4.19-pre2

2001-09-01  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* po/POTFILES.in: fixed typo on hfs/xfs.c, which caused all sorts of automake
headaches, when compiling outside of the source directory.
* using gettext 0.10.39, which includes a new gettext.m4.  0.10.38 had some
problems.
* released 1.4.19-pre1

2001-08-20  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>

* po/ja.po: new version
* released 1.4.18

2001-08-18  Andrew Clausen  <clausen@gnu.org>
* fairly major bug fix: the FAT resize constraint now computes a correct
minimum size.  It was underestimating.
* libparted/fs_fat/fat.c (fat_get_resize_constraint): moved the "+ 64" to
_get_min_size
* (_calc_resize_data_size): new function, which calculates how much free
space is available in the new partition during the resize, which excludes
the free space that will be created afterwards (like, the space saved by
shrinking the file allocation tables, for example)
* (_test_size): now uses (_calc_resize_data_size)
* parted/parted.c (_solution_check_distant): implemented.  (asks a user if
a solution to a constraint is "good enough", where the solution is very
different to what they asked for)
* (do_mkfs, do_mkpartfs, do_move, do_resize): use _solution_check_distant

August 13th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* released 1.4.18-pre2

August 11th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

* moved Domsch's device_diskioctl.[ch] stuff in device.c, and made it work
for the general case.
* released 1.4.18-pre1
* backed out the gpt code (broken!).  Kept the parts that changed device.c
and disk.c.

August 10th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* added support for Hurd's translator block in the ext2 resizer
* applied Matt Domsch's patch for EFI GPT support

instead.
* released 1.4.17

July 15th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* note: we're using the new gettext + autoconf with hacked gettext.m4.
(replace ac_given_srcdir with ac_srcdir in /usr/share/aclocal/gettext.m4)
* back-ported xfs and jfs probe support
* released 1.4.16

July 11th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* released 1.4.16-pre1

July 10th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed bug in libparted/disk_dos.c _logical_constraint().  If the extended
partition only occupies one cylinder, then we can't construct a not-the-start
constraint (so, we should return the empty set, NULL)
* added FAQ entry for installing GNU/Linux on a Windows box
* added --disable-pc98, to appease msw^W^Wallow distro's that don't need/want
PC98 support to remove the msdos sanity checks that might prevent some weird
partition tables from being detected.
* relaxed the msdos sanity check in the special case that a partition's
cylinder value == "real value % 1024", rather than LBA magic, due to buggy
partition programs (not us!)
* the msdos sanity checks are only activated if the second sector (where
the pc98 table resides) is non-zero

	- error behaviour set to 1 (continue)
* released 1.4.13

May 23rd 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* ext2_inode_relocator.c, added (long) casts in fprintf() (thanks Timshel)
* added AC_CHECK_FUNC(rl_completion_matches) to configure.in, and in ui.c, use
that instead of completition_matches, if it is available.
(completition_matches is being phased out)
* replaced "type -p" in configure.in with:
	LFS_CFLAGS="`getconf LFS_CFLAGS`" && CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $LFS_CFLAGS"
(ash doesn't support type -p)
* added #include <string.h> to libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_mkfs.c (thanks pixel)

* create revision 1.0 ext2 file systems (and not rev 0.1)

May 14th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* configure.in: s/which/type -p/

May 2nd 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* #include <string.h> in fs_ext2/interface.c
* fs_ext2/ext2_mkfs.c: ext2_mkfs() now makes most of the "use-default"
parameters 0.  (This isn't a public interface, so no incompat)
* added CFLAGS=-Werror (yay!)

April 29th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* applied move syntax patch (make END specification optional) from
Vincent Stelhé <vincent.stelhe@free.fr>.  Thanks!

April 28th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

success
* released 1.4.12-pre1
* cleaned (and fixed endian bug) in mkfs code... directory entries are made
properly now
* released 1.4.12-pre2 (internally)
* null terminate dir names (fix previous mkfs changes)
* released 1.4.12-pre3 (internally)
* other random endian mkfs stuff
* released 1.4.12-pre4

April 24th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed example 2 in doc/USER (section 2.5.2)
* changed msdos_write() (in libparted/disk_dos.c), to make the per-logical
container extended partition just wrap the contained logical partition
(and not extend to the end of the main extended partition)  Apparantly
this fixes problems with other partition programs.
* configure.in: CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_REENTRANT" - useful for threaded users
of libparted

April 13th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed buglet... the arbitary/safe/conservative number of 5 was chosen for
the number of heads to try when aligning logical partitions.  However, for
(virtual) disks with heads < 5, this causes wrap-around, causing recursive
partition tables.  Fortunately, heads < 5 is rare, except for using Parted
on files, or whatever.  s/5/PED_MIN (5, dev->heads)/ in disk_dos.c
* minor changes to doc/USER and doc/FAT

April 11th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* changed int -> size_t for lots of stuff in parted/strlist.c

* libparted/fs_ext2/ext2_resize.c, type-cast to (void*) first arg to
ped_realloc()

* added assertions ped_partition_is_active (part) for
ped_partition_{set,get}_name()

March 28th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* for msdos disk labels: if the partitions aren't alignend properly, now
makes an attempt during msdos_partition_align() to align properly.
* new pt_BR.po (thanks Eliphas)

March 26th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* moved Sun disk geometry sanity checks from sun_probe() into a separate
helper function _check_geometry_sanity(), which is now called by sun_open().

labels, free space partitions should be > 5 * disk->dev->sectors, not > 5 * 63.

March 17th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* now explicitly requires autoconf 2.49b, and will complain sufficiently...

March 16th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* changed include/parted/endian.h, to use __u{16,32} instead of unsigned
{short, int}

* released 1.4.10

March 14th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

* made the alignment-workaround go by default in script mode, and made it
more inviting ("it is safe to ignore", etc.)
* released 1.4.10-pre1

February 21st 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

Sun...
* fixed bsd_partition_align() - checks if the intersection of two
constraints exists, before trying to find a solution.
* released 1.4.9-pre1

February 2nd 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* updated doc/USER, wrt CHS/LBA, etc.

February 1st 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed ext2 mkfs code: the lost+found inode gets create/modify/access time
time (NULL), rather than 1969 ;-)
* fixed fat: changed FatCluster from __s32 to __u32.  Arghh.

January 29th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* added Sun regression tests
* released 1.4.8

January 24th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

pass an fs_type != NULL to ped_partition_set_system()
* added partition flags for Sun disk labels
* released 1.4.8-pre1 (internally)
* more hacking on Sun stuff
* released 1.4.8-pre2

January 23rd 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* added Sun disk label support (thanks Ben!)
* added UFS probe/clobber support (thanks Ben!)
* added PED_DEVICE_FILE support (as opposed to going through
PED_DEVICE_UNKNOWN)

January 18th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* we now require autoconf 2.49b to build configure from configure.in,
because it provides the new AC_CHECK_SIZEOF
* use new AC_CHECK_SIZEOF for off_t.
* changed configure.in to match the new AC_CHECK_TYPE
* hacked libtool.m4 (!)... I hope this all gets fixed properly, soon...

January 17th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* tried to make libparted/device.c more portable
* libparted/fs_fat/bootsector.h - fixed the size of the FAT16 part of the
union... needed an extra byte in boot_code.  (purely aesthetic ;-)

January 15th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* released 1.4.7

January 10th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed ped_file_system_clobber() - wasn't leaving/fetching exceptions
properly

January 9th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed _calc_min_logical_start() - was horribly broken.  Only affects the new
work-around for "cylinder not aligned", etc.
* released 1.4.7-pre4 (internally)
* don't try to guess the geometry for a second time... (introduced
geom_already_guessed to PedDevice)
* released 1.4.7-pre5

January 8th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* ext2_mkfs now enables file-type by default.
* ped_partition_new()  (not DISK_partition_new()) calls
ped_partition_set_system() now.  Makes sure it calls ped_partition_set_system()
for extended partitions too!
* released 1.4.7-pre1 (internally)
* added documentation for ped_file_system_clobber()
* fixed semantics for ped_file_system_clobber() - they need to change, since
ped_file_system_probe() is different...
* released 1.4.7-pre2 (internally)
* released 1.4.7-pre3

January 6th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* msdos_partition_new() if there is no file system passed, sets the system
to 0x83.  0 is a bad choice, because it means it isn't a partition.  It's
an even worse choice, because it will make msdos_probe() fail.
* released 1.4.6

January 5th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* "partition not aligned" workaround (similar to that in 1.2.x)
* uses dgettext (PACKAGE, ...) instead of gettext (...).  Updated API docs,
to reflect this (for ped_partition_flag_get_name(), etc.)
* released 1.4.6-pre1
* fixed brain-dead bug, dealing with min_geom in _primary_constraint()
in libparted/disk_dos.c
* released 1.4.6-pre2 (internally)
* fixed another bug (out-by-one, in _primary_constraint(), again)
* added bindtextdomain() to ped_init()
* released 1.4.6-pre3 (internally)

January 4th 2001 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* removed that annoying "Parted's boot loader" message

a PedGeometry, not a PedPartition (what was I thinking?!)

December 21st 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

* fixed bug in ext2_mkfs(): if there isn't enough room for per-group
metadata in the last block group, then chop it off!

endian-awarenize (?) it!!!

is in the file-system.
* added a note about "make install-libs" for e2fsprogs

November 30th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

all file systems, that require more GDT blocks to get corrupted!!!  OUCH!!!
* fixed regression tests, to test GDT growth

* released 1.4.3

November 19th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed a few mistakes in doc/USER (thanks Stefan!)
* now uses the en_US locale for numbers.  (quick fix, because the "lexer"
isn't properly i18nized yet - I'll fix this properly next week, because
I intend to do Major Surgery TM on the command parser anyway).  Basic
problem is: the lexer says a number is [0-9.]+, but in Europe, s/\./,/.
* released 1.4.2

November 16th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* loop-back is now probed last.

other functions to meet this.
* released 1.4.0-pre6
* fixed a stupid bug introduced in 1.4.0-pre6, in libparted/disk_dos.c,
read_table()  Was passing a pointer to a pointer of a constraint, as opposed to
the pointer.

mac_partition_new(), it was checking for failure, but missed out the '!'.
* released 1.4.0-pre4

October 21st 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* commented out the linux-swap Linux 2.0 warning.  It annoys more users than it
helps.
* merged 1.2.11
* hacked around the mac-boot & no-HFS problem, by setting the file system
temporarily, in mac_partition_set_system()  (YUCK!)
* applied a patch from Masahiro Sakai <ZVM01052@nifty.ne.jp>.  Now uses
mbs* as opposed to iconv.  That fixes lots of brokeness, but there may be
problems for utf-8 users... but this will be solved by gettext in future.
* released 1.4.0-pre3
* fixed the annoying linux-swap on mac bug (it was trying to set the swap
flag, before setting the partition type to linux-swap, which caused the
Mac disk label code to complain)

* uses Apple_UNIX_SVR2 (instead of Unix)
* merged 1.2.11-pre1

October 15th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

stuff.

* added documentation WRT LVM and RAID
* updated documentation, to much current command set

September 17th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

are constrained independently.  This allows constraints for extended partitions,
keeping the extended partitions big enough to fit the logical partitions.

* released 1.3.3

September 10th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

August 25th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* fixed msdos_probe() - it didn't like LBA partitions
* reverted ped_partition_set_flag().  Doesn't call ped_partition_set_system()
anymore.  What was I thinking?  It's the responsibiltiy of *_set_flag() to call
ped_partition_set_system().
* added RAID and LVM partition flags
* fixed a bug in alloc_root_dir() - now allocates enough clusters in
FAT16 -> FAT32 conversions (!)  Rarely does damage (and always avoidable,
if you follow the advise)
* fat_get_resize_constraint() is 100% accurate now (min_size wasn't accurate
before)

August 19th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>

assumed that the last partition would be the highest numbered partition.

non x86 arch's.

linux-swap.)

July 9th 2000 - Andrew Clausen <clausen@gnu.org>
* read-only Mac partition map support is semi-working :-)
* PC98 is looking a bit nicer now.

* after much agonizing and procrastination, decided not to have a mode command.
Why would you want interactive mode if you're not an a tty?  I'm open to
persuasion ;-)   (Also, it seems wrong making it "mode".  It should be a
--option instead).

* fixed severe bug: fat_convert_directory():  new_trav and old_trav went
out of sync, in some circumstances!!!  OUCH!!!  (Probably didn't show up
on 99.9% people's systems, because it usually will either be out-by-zero
